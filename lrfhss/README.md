# LR-FHSS Example

This application demonstrates **Long Range - Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS)** transmission capabilities using the USP/RAC framework. LR-FHSS is a transmission-only modulation that combines frequency hopping with spread spectrum techniques for robust long-range communication. The application sends periodic transmissions with structured payloads and provides button-triggered immediate transmission cycles.

## Key Features

- **Frequency Hopping**: Automatic frequency hopping across multiple channels for interference resilience
- **Spread Spectrum**: Enhanced sensitivity and range through coding rate optimization
- **Structured Payload**: Packets contain header ("LR-FHSS:") and incremental counter
- **Button-Controlled Operation**: Immediate transmission trigger via user button
- **Periodic Transmissions**: Configurable transmission intervals with automatic scheduling
- **LED Feedback**: Visual TX activity indication

## Configuration

### Using CMake

| Parameter               | Default Value       | Description                                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `LRFHSS_FREQUENCY_HZ`   | `866500000`         | Operating frequency in Hz (866.5 MHz)          |
| `LRFHSS_TX_POWER_DBM`   | `14`                | Transmit power in dBm                          |
| `LRFHSS_PAYLOAD_SIZE`   | `50`                | Payload size in bytes                          |
| `LRFHSS_TX_INTERVAL_MS` | `5000`              | Interval between transmissions in milliseconds |

## Compilation


**Build LR-FHSS transmitter:**
```bash
west build --pristine --board xiao_nrf54l15/nrf54l15/cpuapp --shield semtech_loraplus_expansion_board --shield semtech_wio_lr2021 usp_zephyr/samples/usp/sdk/lrfhss
```

**Flash the firmware:**
```bash
west flash --runner pyocd
```

## Usage

1. **Flash Firmware**: Load the compiled firmware to your device

2. **Connect Console**: Open serial console to monitor transmission activity
   ```bash
   minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200
   ```

3. **Start Transmission**: Press the user button to begin LR-FHSS transmission cycle

4. **Monitor Activity**:
   - LED indicates TX activity during transmissions
   - UART shows transmission progress and packet counters

## Expected Output

### Button Press and Transmission
```

```

## Technical Notes

- **Transmission Interval**: 5-second default interval between automatic transmissions
- **Priority Level**: Uses `RAC_HIGH_PRIORITY` for reliable radio access
- **Payload Structure**: "LR-FHSS:" header (8 bytes) + counter (4 bytes) + random data
- **Button Debouncing**: 500ms debounce time to prevent multiple triggers
- **Frequency Hopping**: Automatic hop sequence generation for each transmission
- **Thread Safety**: Cooperative scheduling for deterministic behavior

## Regulatory Considerations

- **Frequency Compliance**: Ensure operating frequency complies with local regulations
- **Power Limits**: Verify transmission power is within regional limits
- **Duty Cycle**: Some regions may have duty cycle restrictions for continuous transmission
