# Ping Pong Example

This application demonstrates **bidirectional LoRa communication** between two devices using a ping-pong exchange protocol. The application features automatic role management where devices can dynamically switch between manager and subordinate modes, along with optional periodic LoRa uplink functionality for multi-protocol demonstration.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Role Management**: Devices start as subordinates and can become managers by pressing the user button
- **Automatic Exchange Protocol**: Implements PING/PONG message exchange with payload validation
- **Error Handling & Retry Logic**: Includes timeout handling, CRC error recovery, and configurable retry limits
- **Payload Structure**: Uses structured payload with header ("PING"/"PONG"), separator, and counter
- **LED Indicators**: TX and RX LEDs provide visual feedback during transmissions
- **Optional Periodic LoRa Uplink**: If activated at compilation, a periodic LoRa TX is sent in parallel by the Manager

### Operation Modes

- **Manager Mode**: Initiates exchanges, adds delays between transactions, tracks successful/failed exchanges
- **Subordinate Mode**: Listens for PING messages and responds with PONG messages

### Protocol Details

The ping-pong protocol uses a structured 6-byte payload:
- **Header**: "PING" or "PONG" (4 bytes)
- **Separator**: 0x00 (1 byte)
- **Counter**: Exchange counter (1 byte)

## Compilation


**Build:**
```bash
west build --pristine --board xiao_nrf54l15/nrf54l15/cpuapp --shield semtech_loraplus_expansion_board --shield semtech_wio_lr2021 usp_zephyr/samples/usp/sdk/ping_pong
```

**Flash the firmware:**
```bash
west flash --runner pyocd
```

## Usage

1. Flash the same firmware to both devices (role is determined dynamically)
2. Power on both devices - they will start in subordinate mode (listening)
3. Press the user button on one device to make it the manager and start the ping-pong exchange
4. Observe TX/RX LEDs and UART debug output for communication status
